# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

# Project description 

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a retail bank. Customer churn occurs when clients stop doing business with a bank, which leads to revenue loss and higher acquisition costs. The aim of this project is to identify churn drivers, analyze customer segments, and recommend retention strategies using data analysis and visualization.

# Overview

- Total Customers: 10,000

- Churned Customers: 2,037 (20.37%)

- Active Members: 5,151

- Avg Churned Balance: 91.11K

- The dashboard provides insights into churn across age, gender, geography, balance, tenure, credit card status, and risk groups.

# Business Problem 

- Banks face a major challenge in reducing churn. Losing customers not only lowers profitability but also costs more than retaining existing ones. This project focuses on:

- Understanding churn patterns across demographics, financial behavior, and engagement.

- Building a dashboard for monitoring churn metrics.

- Recommending actionable strategies for retention.
